# AI Campus Placement Agent

An AI-powered multi-agent assistant that helps students prepare for campus placements through resume analysis, job matching, personalized learning roadmaps, skill gap analysis, and interactive mock interviews.

This is a production-quality application built for the **Kaggle AI Agents Intensive Course Capstone Project**.

## Why is this an AI Agent System (and NOT a Chatbot)?

A typical chatbot operates as a single-turn or multi-turn conversational loop, where a single large language model (LLM) responds directly to user queries. 

In contrast, the **AI Campus Placement Agent** implements a **Coordinated Multi-Agent Architecture**:
1. **Orchestrated Workflow**: A single, central `CoordinatorAgent` receives the initial workspace context (resume, target job description, target company profiles).
2. **Task Delegation**: The coordinator executes a single structured LLM call to save token costs and prevent rate-limiting, and then delegates the resulting data subsets to specialized sub-agents.
3. **Dedicated Domain Responsibilities**: Each specialized agent is modeled as an independent Python class focusing on a single task:
   * **ResumeAgent**: Evaluates ATS formatting, experiences, strengths, and suggests grammar improvements.
   * **JobMatchAgent**: Performs keyword extraction and evaluates match percentages against the target role.
   * **SkillGapAgent**: Maps missing skills into an actionable table showing learning times, importance, and priority.
   * **RoadmapAgent**: Generates a custom 6-week curriculum with topic deep-dives and estimated study hours.
   * **InterviewAgent**: Generates tailored interview questions and handles dynamic, real-time responses scoring technical accuracy and communication.

## Features

1. **Resume Analysis & ATS Scoring**: Extract text from PDF resumes, run grammar & style checks, identify weaknesses, and calculate a grounded ATS Score.
2. **Job Description Matching**: Paste a Job Description to compare candidate metrics against corporate requirements, listing the exact changes needed to pass initial screenings.
3. **Skill Gap Remediation Table**: Get a prioritizing list of missing skills detailing estimated learning times, resource links, and custom project suggestions.
4. **6-Week Study Roadmap**: Access a weekly preparation calendar mapping theoretical topics, coding challenges, and revision items.
5. **Interactive Mock Interview Simulator**: Engage in a live, conversational chat with the Interview Agent. Answers are evaluated dynamically on technical accuracy, communication style, and confidence indicators.
6. **Static Company Profiles**: Contains pre-cached interview processes, hiring guidelines, and preparation advice for major companies: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, TCS, Infosys, Accenture, Capgemini, and Wipro.
7. **Comprehensive PDF Reports**: Generates and compiles a formatted, multi-page PDF document summarizing placement analysis and roadmaps using ReportLab.

## Demonstration Guidelines (3–5 Minute Capstone Pitch)

1. **Slide 1: Problem & Multi-Agent Solution** (30s)
   * Explain the friction students experience when jumping between disconnected tools for resumes, ATS, calendars, and mock coding.
   * Introduce the Coordinated Multi-Agent concept.
2. **Action 1: Upload & Process** (45s)
   * Upload a sample resume PDF, select "Google" or "Amazon", paste a job description, and click "Analyze".
   * Draw attention to the **Agent Progress Panel** showing live steps as each agent finishes its delegated calculations.
3. **Action 2: Dashboard Deep Dive** (60s)
   * Show the visual gauges (ATS, Job Match).
   * Expand the strengths/weaknesses accordions.
   * Point out the skill gap priority matrix and the timeline roadmap.
4. **Action 3: Interactive Interview Simulator** (45s)
   * Start the mock interview. Type a response to the current question.
   * Show the immediate response evaluation (technical score, communication score, recommendations) rendering in the sidebar.
5. **Action 4: PDF Compilation** (30s)
